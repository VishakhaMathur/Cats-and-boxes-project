    comment: I discussed the approach to solve task 6. I didn't quite understand 
             how to return the array by transforming it. Also, I was failing some of the tests in task 7,
             so I discussed the idea of task 7 with Vivian. I got the structure of the code for task 7
             by the help of a tutor on ed forum and drop-in session.
